Description: This is the source code for the game. In implements the main
function that is the driver of the program. In also includes a clear function
that attemps to "push" the face up print up beyond the screen.
Purpose: This code is where all the fcns are put together to run a game of memory. This runs a 2 player game where each player must
match cards with the same value to get points. The player with the most won cards at the end wins!
