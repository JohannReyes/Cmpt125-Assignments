Description: This is the source code for the game. In implements the main
function that is the driver of the program. In also includes a clear function
that attemps to "push" the face up print up beyond the screen.
Purpose: This code contains all the fcns for editing the win pile of each player, their linked lists of cards won. These include
fcns that creates their linked list and adds the cards they have won through out the game to the linked lists and also a fcn
that clears their linked list at the end of the game.
