Academic honesty statement: I hereby confirm that this is my own work and I have
not violated any of SFUâ€™s Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct (S10.01).
Description: This is the source code for the game. In implements the main
function that is the driver of the program. In also includes a clear function
that attemps to "push" the face up print up beyond the screen.
Purpose: This code is contains the fcns that help run the main frame of the game. These inlcude check fncs that decide whether 
player inputs are valid, as well as checking if the player has chosen cards that match or not. This also adds the won cards the the
players win pile and also checks hwo many cards are still left in play, hence checking whether the game is over or not.
